## Ground rules

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, there are 3 key points that must be covered. By being involved with eggX _in any way_, you agree to the following rules:

1. **Harrasment of any form is not tolerated.**
We hope to make the eggX a place where anyone can enjoy learning about tech and grow. That is not possible if we engage in offensive activites. 

    Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class and economic status.

    If you feel that you've been harrassed or you know someone who has, or you've witnesed harrasment at an eggX event, please let us know by contacting an exec personally, or by emailing watchdog@eggx.io

2. **No stealing or plagarism.**
We have a variety of events, workshops and projects that you may participate in. It is your responsibility to protect the security of others' belongings by not taking anything that isn't yours. If you believe something's been lost, please let us know. Ensure that any work you submit is yours and you've included credits wherever relevant.

    If you've experienced or noticed theft or plagarism, please let us know by contacting an exec personally, or by emailing watchdog@eggx.io

3. **Lend a helping hand.**
This isn't the Olympics. We want to nurture a community that takes care of itself, so we encourage everyone to lend a helping hand whenever they can. Maybe someone's stuck on something and you know that topic well, offer to help them out. If you've notice someone having a tough time, maybe beause of a lack of accessibility or some other incident, call for the attention of an exec and do your best to help them out.

## Becoming a member

We are a club at Carleton University that aims to make Computer Science more approachable to all kinds of students.

We introduced the concept of membership as a way to protect the identity of people who attend our events/workshops and don't plan to be further involved with the club.

If you're interested in participating in [Projects](#projects), or you'd like to have an [eggX Resume](#eggx-resume) developed for you, you would need to be a member. Lucky for you, it's really simple! Here are the ways you can join:

- Join our club through [CUSAHub](cusahub.online)
- Register as a member through [our website](eggx.io/join)
- Meet us at a general event or seminar

**Participation as a member is completely free, with no exceptions** and we have partnerships with several technology companies that operate in the Ottawa-area (talk about job prospects!)

## Getting set-up

[_back to top_](#eggx-manual)

In this section, we assume that you're already a [member](#member). As a member, you automatically have:

- An eggX ID, which is your unique tag. You'll use this ID to check-in at our events and access resources.

- An [eggX Resume](#eggx-resume), which is a highlight of all your accomplishments at events, workshops and projects, as well as basic info.

You will additionally need to do the following:

- [Login to the eggX Share](#accessing-the-eggx-network-share)
- [Setup a GitHub account](#setting-up-your-github)

So lets get started!

### Accessing the eggX Share

Congrats! You're special; you're a member. You have access to the eggX network which is a private share of all sorts of content related to events, workshops and projects. It is also where you will work with your team to build something new!

The eggX Share can be found at [eggx.io/share](https://eggx.io/share) .

As a member, you will already have an account setup for you. To login for the first time, click on `First Time Login` where you'll be able to verify your account using the email your provided us when you became a member. From that email, you'll be able to enter a password for your account.

When you've created your password, login with your username as your [`eggx ID`](#eggx-id) and the password you created.

If you forget your password at any point, just lick on `Forgot password` and we'll get you up and running again!

### Setting up your GitHub

GitHub is a lovely place where you can publish your code and resources publicly or privately.

To create a GitHub account, visit [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) . You can use any username you want (and you can change it later, but with consequences).

Repositories (repos) are the primary medium for sharing code. Imagine that a repo is a virtual bookshelf where you place your books (or files). Once, you've created your account, create a new repo at [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) , give it the name 'example-repo', make the repo public, and **make sure you check 'Initialize this repository with a README'** which will create a `README.md` file which is basically a description of the repository. Ignore other setting and click `Create repository`. You will now be taken to your repo page.

Try uploading a file by dragging and dropping it onto the page. This is basically how GitHub works, you can use more complex methods and integrations, but that's for another day.

## Finding something to do

[_back to top_](#eggx-manual)

Once you're all set-up, you're probably going to be eager to get your hands dirty. Well luck for you, we have plenty of options for you! As an outline, at eggX, we have:

- Outdoor events
- Sponsored talks
- A semester-eide coding competition (a.k.a projects!)
- Workshops

In every option, there will be prizes and giveaways available to everyone who attends!

Every, single, event we host will be listed on our website at [eggx.io/events](eggx.io/events) . You'll also be able to register for the event through that page (if the event requires it).

### Projects

Projects are the biggest part of each semester, they are something you don't want to miss! At the beginning of each semester, we hold an 'Into to Projects' talk which is where you'll really get to know more about what projects actuall are, you'll also be able to choose a `domain` and find teammates.

To participate in projects, you will need to declare the following:

- Your teammates: you will work in teams of 4
- Your project's domain
- A project description (explained later)

**All projects (that follow the ground-rules) will be accepted, no question**, and we will assign a mentor to your team. Your mentor will guide you through the process of completing your project and will lead team meetups.

#### Project Domains

A project's domain is a generalized field that a project is a part of. We allow members to choose between 4 domains: `mobile`, `web`, `ai`, and `theory`.

1. The mobile domain is for any project that deals with mobile applications. A project in this domain must be able to be demoed on an Android or iOS device.

2. The web domain is for projects that live online. So that ranges from websites to webapps to native web solutions. Projects in this domain must have a primary web entrypoint and must be hosted.

3. The AI domain is, as the name implies, for AI projects. We work with Carleton's AI Society to provide this domain, and anyone who wants to venture into this exiting new are, will do so through their curriculum.

4. The theory domain is for projects that focus on the theory of Computer Science. Such a project will focus on analysing/designing/implementsing algorithms, architectures and other theoretical concepts.

#### Project Description

A project description is a run-down of what your project is. It includes:

- the name of your project
- an overview of your project
- why you want to pursue the project
- tools you'll need (think as big as you want)

You should come together with your team to decide on the above points. We reccomend you do this at the 'Into to Projects' talk because you'll be able to submit your project description immediately and get started.

If you missed the 'Intro to Projects' talk, your team can also submit the project description via the [eggX Share](eggx.io/share) . If you haven't setup your team yet, that can also be done from the eggX Share.

That's it folks! Anything else that we missed in this document can be found at our website: [eggx.io](eggx.io) .

Have fun!

## Glossary

### eggX ID

A tag that every eggX [member](#member) is given when they join. Members use their ID to check-in at events and login to the [eggX Network Share](eggx.io/share). It is reccomended that members check-in at events as checking-in typically unlocks exclusive prizes.

### eggX Resume

A personalized website developed for every eggX member. It lists their achievements at every event, workshop and project they've been involved with. An eggX Resume may also include basic info about the member such as their name and school. _Personal information may be redacted from the eggX Resume._

### Member

A member is a student that has officially become involved with eggX. This can take the form of joining the club at Carleton University, or signing up at an event. A person who participates in an eggX event/workshop is not automatically a member, and we make efforts to anonymise the identity of such a person at our functions. _Effort is also made to protect the privacy of members of eggX, however, due to their nature of involvement (e.g. projects), some personal details may remain._
