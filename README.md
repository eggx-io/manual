## Ground rules

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, there are 3 key points that must be covered. By being involved with eggX _in any way_, you agree to the following rules:

1. **Harrasment of any form is not tolerated.**
We hope to make the eggX a place where anyone can enjoy learning about tech and grow. That is not possible if we engage in offensive activites. 

    Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class and economic status.

    If you feel that you've been harrassed or you know someone who has, or you've witnesed harrasment at an eggX event, please let us know by contacting an exec personally, or by emailing watchdog@eggx.io

2. **No stealing or plagarism.**
We have a variety of events, workshops and projects that you may participate in. It is your responsibility to protect the security of others' belongings by not taking anything that isn't yours. If you believe something's been lost, please let us know. Ensure that any work you submit is yours and you've included credits wherever relevant.

    If you've experienced or noticed theft or plagarism, please let us know by contacting an exec personally, or by emailing watchdog@eggx.io

3. **Lend a helping hand.**
This isn't the Olympics. We want to nurture a community that takes care of itself, so we encourage everyone to lend a helping hand whenever they can. Maybe someone's stuck on something and you know that topic well, offer to help them out. If you've noticed someone having a tough time, maybe beause of a lack of accessibility or some other incident, call for the attention of an exec and do your best to help them out.

## Becoming a member

We are a club at Carleton University that aims to make Computer Science more approachable to all kinds of students.

We introduced the concept of membership as a way to protect the identity of people who attend our events/workshops and don't plan to be further involved with the club.

If you're interested in participating in [Projects](#projects), or you'd like to have an [eggX Resume](#eggx-resume) developed for you, you would need to be a member. Lucky for you, it's really simple! Here are the ways you can join:

- Register as a member through [this form](https://forms.gle/j3uxyxA5E7go43xbA)
- Join our club through [CUSAClubs](http://cusaclubs.ca)

**Participation as a member is completely free, with no exceptions** and we are working on partnerships with several technology companies that operate in the Ottawa-area (talk about job prospects!)

## Getting set-up

[_back to top_](#eggx-manual)

In this section, we assume that you're already a [member](#member). As a member, you automatically have:

- An [eggX ID](#eggx-id), which is your unique tag. You'll use this ID to check-in at our events and access resources.

- An [eggX Resume](#eggx-resume), which is a highlight of all your accomplishments at events, workshops and projects, as well as basic info.

You will additionally need to do the following:

- [Setup a GitHub account](#setting-up-your-github)

So lets get started!

### Setting up your GitHub

GitHub is a lovely place where you can publish your code and resources publicly or privately.

To create a GitHub account, visit [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) . You can use any username you want (and you can change it later, but with consequences).

Repositories (repos) are the primary medium for sharing code. Imagine that a repo is a virtual bookshelf where you place your books (or files). Once, you've created your account, create a new repo at [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) , give it the name `'example-repo'`, make the repo public, and **make sure you check 'Initialize this repository with a README'** which will create a `README.md` file which is basically a description of the repository. Ignore other setting and click `Create repository`. You will now be taken to your repo page.

Try uploading a file by dragging and dropping it onto the page. This is basically how GitHub works, you can use more complex methods and integrations, but that's for another day.

To get rid of your newly create repo, head over to the `Settings` page in your repository (it has the gear icon), scroll all the way down into the "Danger Zone" and click on "Delete this repository".

You'll be added to the [Fall 2020](https://github.com/orgs/eggx-io/teams/f2020-draft) draft team (once it opens up) where you can get more info and see more specific repositories hosted by us!

## Finding something to do

[_back to top_](#eggx-manual)

Once you're all set-up, you're probably going to be eager to get your hands dirty. Well luck for you, we have plenty of options for you! As an outline, at eggX, we have:

- Online events
- Sponsored talks
- A semester-wide coding competition (a.k.a projects!)
- Workshops

In every option, there will be prizes and giveaways available to everyone who attends!

Every, single, event we host will be listed on our website at [eggx.io/events](https://eggx.io/events) . You'll also be able to register for the event through that page (if the event requires it).

### Projects

Projects are the biggest part of each semester, they are something you don't want to miss! At the beginning of each semester, we hold an 'Intro to eggX' talk which is where you'll really get to know more about what projects actuall are, you'll also be able to choose a `domain` and find teammates.

To participate in projects, you will need to declare the following:

- Your experience in coding
- Your membership type
- Your preferred project domain

This semester (Fall-2020), we're working on building a game like the popular invention game, "Little Alchemy". You may be placed in a team of 3-4 based on overall numbers and experience. Everyone will be building the same game, just in different ways. Our hope is for everyone to come together at the end and see how just these 3 programming domains (frontend, backend & mobile) work together to shape the technology we use on a daily basis. You'll hopefully learn more than just how to code or how to design, you'll be able to think critically of and even begin to critisize existing software in the real world. We will assign a mentor to you/your team who will guide you through the process of completing your project and will lead team meetups.

#### Project Domains

A project's domain is a generalized field that a project is a part of. We allow members to choose between 3 domains: `mobile`, `frontend`, `backend`.

1. The mobile domain is for any project that deals with mobile applications. A project in this domain must be able to be demoed on a physical/virtual Android device. Google Play fees my apply to you if you choose to publish your app on the store. Unfortunately, we are unable to facilitate iOS development at this time.

2. The frontend domain is for projects that live online. So that ranges from websites to webapps to native web solutions. Projects in this domain must have a primary web entrypoint and must be hosted.

3. The AI domain is, as the name implies, for Artificial Intelligence (and Machine Learning/Deep Learning) projects. We work with Carleton's AI Society to provide this domain, and anyone who wants to venture into this exiting new area, will do so through their curriculum.

4. The backend domain is for projects that focus on building offline/endpoint code. Projects in this domain will focus on writing algorithms and designing data structures among other concepts.

That's it folks! Anything else that we missed in this document can be found at our website: [eggx.io](https://eggx.io). If you still can't find what you're looking for, send us an email at info@eggx.io

Have fun!

## Glossary

### eggX ID

A tag that every eggX [member](#member) is given when they join. Members use their ID to check-in at events and login to the [eggX Network Share](https://eggx.io/share). It is reccomended that members check-in at events as checking-in typically unlocks exclusive prizes.

### eggX Resume

A personalized website developed for every eggX member. It lists their achievements at every event, workshop and project they've been involved with. An eggX Resume may also include basic info about the member such as their name and school. _Personal information may be redacted from the eggX Resume._

### Member

A member is a student that has officially become involved with eggX. This can take the form of joining the club at Carleton University, or signing up at an event. A person who participates in an eggX event/workshop is not automatically a member, and we make efforts to anonymise the identity of such a person at our functions. _Effort is also made to protect the privacy of members of eggX, however, due to their nature of involvement (e.g. projects), some personal details may remain._
